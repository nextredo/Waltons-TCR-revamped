## Physical
- Add more connectors to the power distribution bus
- Make a bus for the serial data and serial clock lines
- Fix up barrel plug wiring (hot glue)
- Along with:
	- Continuing the rest of the project
	- Mounting sensors
	- Testing sensors
- Change brightness knob so it controls the brightness of the clock's main orange LED instead of the LCD screen's brightness
	- LCD's brightness can be controlled by the Arduino digitally
	- Plus, it's more likely you'll adjust the main brightness for at night and day vs the LCD's
- Add another resistor in series for the LED so it can be brighter


## Software
- Code the thing
- Do the thing with the code
- Make it go
